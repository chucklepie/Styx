Level editor instructions

Whatever level you current have selected from the main menu is edited when you select edit level.

When you save the level it will overwrite the existing level file.  Backup the level files first, or download them from http://www.retrospec.co.uk/nwalker/styx/

Green gates 1,2,3 are visible to the user on playing and when walked over are removed and any close gates with the same number (1,2,3) appear and block thoroughfare

Green and red gates 4,5,6 are invisible and when walked over start (green) or stop (red) the  mammy spiders, fish or demon spiders respectively.

Multiple green and multiple red gates can be used to invoke nice effects, e.g. multiple blocks, multiple starts, etc.  See standard levels.

Fish always move right and start from wherever a fish start block is placed.  You do not need to put sea down, it just looks nice and makes the player turn blue (which can be toggled through the function keys).

The demon always faces left.
